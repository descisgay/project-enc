Project-enc is an open-source Node.JS encryption tool that uses seed based encryption and decryption. (Similar how minecraft generates worlds based on a unique seed)

In order to encrypt a string of text, or file, you can either:

A: set a private seed that you share with people who will receive the message/file

B: let Project-enc provide a random 16-digit seed for you to use

This is all just a small project I wanted to work on because i've been watching alot of videos on youtube about privacy, and other things of the same matter.
